# GamePick Component

An interactive game pick component for the Football Pick'em project. Allows users to make picks by clicking directly on team names, with support for locked and results states.

## Features

- **Locked State**: Prevents picks when game has started or deadline passed
- **Results State**: Shows final scores, winner highlighting, and whether user's pick was correct
- **Responsive**: Works well on mobile and desktop
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation support

## Usage

```tsx
import { GamePick } from '@your-org/lib-components/projects/FootballPickem';

// Basic usage - open for picking
<GamePick
  game={gameData}
  onPickTeam={(teamId) => handlePick(teamId)}
/>

// With existing pick
<GamePick
  game={gameData}
  userPick={{ pickedTeamId: 2 }}
  onPickTeam={(teamId) => handlePick(teamId)}
/>

// Locked state (game started)
<GamePick
  game={gameData}
  userPick={{ pickedTeamId: 2 }}
  locked={true}
/>

  game={{
    ...gameData,
